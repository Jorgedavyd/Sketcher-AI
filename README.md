# Sketcher A.I.

Now, artists are feeling the presure of losing their jobs due to the generative A.I.s, but they should be seen as tools that let us have a wider range of expression, that's why I am creating this new application, which helps artists to concentrate in creativity rather than wasting time in mechanical jobs.

## Creator mode:

Creates a sketch of an input image of the anatomical body of the picture, helping the artists drawing on it.

## Sketcher mode:

Creates an full-sketched version of the photo.

## How to use:

1. If you are new to this environment, [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After:

Download pip:

1. Open **cmd**
2. Paste: curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py (Enter)
3. Paste: python get-pip.py
4. Paste: pip install --upgrade pip

5. Install all the requirements from the `requirements.txt`:

Paste: pip install torch torchvision PIL sys copy os gc time collections matplotlib

Now you can close **cmd**

3. From [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MlHu_ir9X8gmzARPKHYzCW4PG-QuSnl3), download the models on `/models/` directory.

4. Go to the `/Sketcher-AI/` folder and run `main.py`.(`python3 main.py`)
